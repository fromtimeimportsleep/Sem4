- Course website: <https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rgurjar/CS218-2024/>
- Office Hours: Fri 4-5 pm, CC315

## Course Contents

**Algorithms**: Basic principles like induction/recursion. Basic paradigms like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms. Beyond the basics: Network Flow and its applications. Reductions.

**Complexity**: Polynomial time and the Complexity classes NP, co-NP. NP-hardness and NP-completeness.

**Advanced topics**: Randomized algorithms, Approximation algorithms. E.g., approximate max-cut, load balancing, min-cut.

### Video on Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT)

Apart from the Veritasium Youtube video shared by Prof., here is a video that very nicely explains the actual algorithm and thinking behind FFT:-<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0
