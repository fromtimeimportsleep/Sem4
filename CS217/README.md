- Course website: <https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/cs217240_2024>
- Office: CC209

## Course Plan

1. Introduction to optimization – class of convex and non-convex optimizations (using cvxpy or Gurobi for solving CPs)

2. Linear programming – simplex, duality, dual simplex (using PuLP for solving LPs)

3. Integer programming – complexity, relaxation to LPs, branch-and-bound, example of Sudoku (could be a lab assignment)

### Part 1: Classical/single-agent AI/ML

4. Linear regression, basis functions, gradient descent

5. MAP estimation, bias-variance, regularization, LASSO etc.

6. Classification – naive Bayes, logistic regression, relationship between them

7. Perceptron, decision tree

8. Deep learning – NN, backpropagation

9. Deep learning – convolutional, recurrent models

10. Probabilistic modeling – basics, Bayes net

11. Probabilistic inference – exact, sampling, approximate

12. Unsupervised learning – k-means clustering

### Part 2: Multi-agent AI/ML

13. Game theory: basics, examples, zero-sum and extensive form

14. Social choice: voting, single-peaked preferences (example only), stable matching

### Part 3: Additional topics

15. Search: DP, uniform cost search, A*

16. MDP: value iteration, reinforcement learning
